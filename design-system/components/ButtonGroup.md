# ButtonGroup

A horizontally or vertically aligned set of related Buttons, typically the commit pair of a form or dialog.

## When to use

- The footer of a dialog, drawer or form
- A confirm / cancel pair at the end of a flow
- A small set of mutually relevant CTAs
- When you need consistent spacing between commit actions

## When NOT to use

- For segmented selection — use ActionGroup
- For dense toolbars — use ActionBar
- When buttons are unrelated and live across the page

## Anatomy

- Container
- Button instances
- Gap between buttons

## Variants

Orientation: horizontal, vertical. Size: sm, md, lg. Alignment: start, end, justified. Defaults to ghost + primary pair.

## Usage example

```tsx
<ButtonGroup />
```

## Do

- Place the primary action last by default
- Keep labels short and parallel
- Limit to 2–3 buttons
- Match button sizing across the group

## Don't

- Don't mix sizes inside the same group
- Don't use more than one primary button
- Don't add a destructive button without confirmation
- Don't reorder primary/secondary across platforms inconsistently

## Accessibility

- Tab order matches the visual order
- Primary action ends the tab sequence (right or bottom)
- Each button keeps its own accessible name
- Maintain a minimum gap so adjacent targets don't merge
- Respect platform conventions for button order
