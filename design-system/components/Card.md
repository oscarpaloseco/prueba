# Card

A self-contained surface that groups a heading, body, optional media and actions about a single entity.

## When to use

- Items in a feed, gallery or grid
- Summarising an entity with a CTA (product, project, article)
- Dashboard tiles that pair text, image and actions
- Catalogues with mixed text and media

## When NOT to use

- For dense rows — use a Table
- For static text blocks — render plain content
- For interactive controls only — use Button or ActionGroup

## Anatomy

- Surface
- Optional image
- Optional avatar
- Header (title + subtitle)
- Body
- Optional footer
- Action buttons

## Variants

Size: sm, md, lg. Variant: default, subtle, accent. Layout: vertical, horizontal. Optional avatar, image, header, footer and actions.

## Props

| Name | Type | Values | Default | Description |
|------|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `Title` | text |  | `Create project` | |

## Usage example

```tsx
<Card
  Title="Create project"
/>
```

## Do

- Lead with the title and most useful metadata
- Keep image aspect ratios consistent across cards
- Use the accent variant sparingly
- Match action emphasis to the card's purpose

## Don't

- Don't nest cards within cards
- Don't mix layouts inside one row
- Don't make the entire card clickable AND nest sub-buttons without care
- Don't crowd with more than 2 actions

## Accessibility

- If the whole card is clickable, expose a single accessible name
- Avoid nesting interactive controls inside a clickable card without explicit semantics
- Keep heading hierarchy consistent with the rest of the page
- Ensure media has alt text or is hidden as decorative
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast for body copy
